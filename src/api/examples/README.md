## [Block Garden - API - Examples](https://kherrick.github.io/block-garden/src/api/examples/)

The **`Block Garden` API Examples** demo visual and interactive effects players can build upon with their own ideas. Each example is a standalone ES module that can be loaded dynamically—either directly from a browser console, a script import, or via a provided bookmarklet.

These examples are particularly useful for learning how to work with **Block Garden’s 3D rendering environment**, **state management**, and **procedural world manipulation** features, which power the game engine’s sandbox-style mechanics. The bookmarklets make it possible to run these demos directly within the game by injecting small modules that render real-time graphics or interactions using the Block Garden runtime.

### Overview of Usage

Players can use these examples to:

- Learn how modular ES6 imports can dynamically add effects or test procedural generation behaviors directly in the game.

Each source corresponds to a themed animation or behavior. Click here to access bookmarklets and see more details.
